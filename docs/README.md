- **[02-ARCHITECTURE.md](02-ARCHITECTURE.md)** - System architecture and technology overview
- **[03-API-REFERENCE.md](03-API-REFERENCE.md)** - Complete API documentation with examples

### Development
- **[04-DEVELOPMENT.md](04-DEVELOPMENT.md)** - Development workflow, testing, and best practices
- **[05-ROADMAP.md](05-ROADMAP.md)** - Feature roadmap and project planning

### Legacy Files
The following files contain historical information and may be outdated:
- `CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md` - Project cleanup history
- `MIGRATION_SETUP_SUMMARY.md` - Migration setup notes
- `LICENSE.md` - License information

## üöÄ Quick Navigation

### For New Developers
1. Start with [Getting Started](01-GETTING-STARTED.md) for setup instructions
2. Read [Architecture Overview](02-ARCHITECTURE.md) to understand the system
3. Check [Development Guide](04-DEVELOPMENT.md) for workflow and best practices

### For API Integration
- See [API Reference](03-API-REFERENCE.md) for complete endpoint documentation
- Check authentication requirements and response formats

### For Project Planning
- Review [Roadmap](05-ROADMAP.md) for upcoming features and priorities
- Check current status and planned improvements

## üìã What's New

This documentation has been reorganized and consolidated from scattered files into a logical structure:

### Consolidated Content
- **Setup instructions** merged from client/server READMEs
- **API documentation** consolidated from multiple endpoint files
- **Development guides** combined from various tool-specific docs
- **Project tasks** organized into comprehensive roadmap

### Removed Redundancy
- Eliminated duplicate library documentation
- Consolidated overlapping setup instructions
- Merged scattered task lists into unified roadmap
- Removed outdated implementation notes

## üîß Maintenance

When making changes to the project:
1. **Update API docs** when adding/modifying endpoints
2. **Update roadmap** when completing features or changing priorities
3. **Keep getting started guide current** with any setup changes
4. **Document architecture changes** in the architecture overview
